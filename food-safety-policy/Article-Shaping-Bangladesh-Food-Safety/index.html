                                      The presence of unsafe and contaminated food poses significant health risks, and these health impacts have far-reaching economic consequences.

These recommendations, stemming from extensive consultations and expert debates facilitated by BSAFE Foundation and Policy Activity, cover various areas such as government coordination, private sector involvement, integrated food safety and nutrition policies, adoption of Good Agricultural Practices, harmonization of standards, pesticide control, technology innovation, reporting mechanisms, hospitality industry regulations, and promotion of collective enterprise.

                                      “Meeting this challenge demands a nuanced strategy. Worldwide, we recognize the vital importance of safe food for health, nutrition, and economic prosperity, but there is no one-size fits all solution. To address this, we’ll need to leverage both local knowledge and global expertise, and that’s where I think USAID can play a role,” she added.

                                      The event highlighted the commitment of USAID and its partners to fostering sustainable solutions to food safety challenges in Bangladesh. These efforts align with the Government of Bangladesh’s drive to address capacity gaps among supply chain actors related to food safety as part of the Bangladesh Perspective Plan to transition to a developed country by 2041, showcasing the crucial interplay between food safety, public health, and national development.

                                      During the dialogue, Md. Ismiel Hossain, ndc, Secretary, Ministry of Food, and the chief guest at the event, emphasized, “Ensuring food safety is not just a responsibility; it's a moral imperative. By fostering collaboration between diverse stakeholders and enacting robust policies, we safeguard the health and well-being of our citizens while advancing our nation's development agenda.”
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
                                      As the dialogue concluded, a collective resolve emerged to continue supporting the Government of Bangladesh in refining and implementing effective food safety policies. The ongoing partnership between BSAFE Foundation and the Policy Activity will be instrumental in building a resilient and prosperous Bangladesh, marked by enhanced food safety standards and systems.
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
                                      Having reinforced the food safety policy recommendations in the presence of key leaders from the Government of Bangladesh and USAID, BSAFE Foundation and Policy Activity will continue to engage the four Ministries with cross-cutting food safety roles: Food, Agriculture, Commerce, and Industries. With support from Policy Activity, BSAFE will pursue the advancement of the submitted food safety policy recommendations with leadership from these Ministries and concerned departments under them. Simultaneously, they will support the nationwide rollout of food safety policy sensitization activities. These activities are jointly led by the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority (BFSA), the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), and the Directorate of National Consumers’ Rights Protection (DNCRP).
